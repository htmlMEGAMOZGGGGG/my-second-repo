Дитинство

Childhood is a wonderful time - there are no worries and problems. And we always remember my childhood as something good.
Mom, dad, grandma, grandpa, all around you. And what is childhood? It's a couple of kindergarten, then school.
This is a pair of games, fun and entertainment. When children are just children, from them nobody demands ( if only to tie the laces and say Hello or goodbye). 
But some things are not as we seem on earth, many children who have no family to love or to salivate them there is absolutely nobody. 
But I think such children are always more stronger. Childhood they the same but different from the childhood of children who have a family. 
But if you remember the childhood everyone, we can say that we were happy. We played street ball, skakalochka garden, hide and seek and many other fun games.
And each of us would love to go back to childhood. It is a pity that it's impossible.

Шкільні роки

I go to school every day like many of my peers. Going to the gymnasium is not just about attending classes, answering the blackboard or doing tests, but also about having fun with friends.
School life is a whole world that surrounds the pupils. Sometimes it is incomprehensible not only to our parents but also to the teachers, who seem to be in it with us, but still, have a different view on many things.
Every morning I pack my backpack and head off to class. As soon as I walk into my gymnasium, hear the noise of children’s voices and the cheers of my friends. I am immediately immersed in the atmosphere.
